| Non Facility Fee Schedule Amount | 35-44    | 9(7).99   | Pricing amount for the non-facility setting. If applicable, the payment amount has been capped at the level of the OPPS Payment Amount mandated by Section 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (See column 107-116 for the OPPS Amounts that are to be used to reduce these payment amounts.).<br>For a description of the computation of the full fee schedule amount, refer to the Federal Register Final Rule for the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.<br>The Medicare limiting charge is set by law at 115 percent of the payment amount for the service furnished by the nonparticipating physician. However, the law sets the payment amount for nonparticipating physicians at 95 percent of the payment amount for participating physicians (i.e. the full fee schedule amount). Calculating 95 percent of 115 percent of an amount is equivalent to multiplying the amount by a factor of 1.0925 (or 109.25 percent). Therefore, to calculate the Medicare limiting charge for a physician service for a locality, multiply the full fee schedule amount by a factor of 1.0925. The result is the Medicare limiting charge for that service for that locality to which the full fee schedule amount applies. |
